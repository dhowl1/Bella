## Project Title
Search engine with ChatGPT API

## Project Description
In "Bella", I aim to create a web-based application that integrates the power of Google's search engine with the ChatGPT conversational ability. This combination will allow users to search for information across the web, as well as interact with the search results in the ChatGPT such as asking clarifications, summaries, or further explanations. The motivation behind this project is that I would like to improve the traditional search experience by making it more interactive and more informative, essentially allowing users to get more information within a single webpage; Arc and Microsoft Bing have developed this feature in their web browsers. This project may be useful for students, researchers, and others who need to use Search engines most of the time and require an understanding of the topic well.

Important to read: There was not many things to do with data structures on my webpage, so I just did a basic one which is stacking history into my stack, which is working well!!
